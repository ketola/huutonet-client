An application that displays the current auctions of a user of the finnish online auction site Huuto.Net. The backend is written in Java and offers a webservice for the AngularJS front. The backend uses Apache Abdera for the Huuto.Net api.

NOTE! Based on http://dev.huuto.net/ "Huutoâ€™s old, xml-based SOMT-API is discontinued as of November 18, 2015" and therefore this integration won't work anymore.
